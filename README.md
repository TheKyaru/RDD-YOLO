The reported results are obtained on a self-collected dataset under specific field conditions.
Performance may vary on datasets collected in different environments.# RDD-SPA

This repository provides the reference implementation of the method proposed in:

**RDD-SPA: An Efficient Visual Recognition Algorithm for Robot-Assisted Rapeseed Pest Control Systems**

## Overview
This code implements the core algorithm described in the paper.  
It is intended for research and academic use.

## Dataset
The reported results are obtained on a self-collected dataset under specific field conditions.  
Performance may vary on datasets collected in different environments.

Due to data ownership and usage restrictions, the dataset used in the paper is **not publicly available**.

## Usage
Please refer to the main script and configuration files for running the model.  
The code is provided as-is for reference and reproducibility purposes.

## Notes
- Experimental results depend on data distribution, acquisition conditions, and parameter settings.
- Reproduced results may differ when using different datasets or environments.
